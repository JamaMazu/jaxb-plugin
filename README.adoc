= JAXB API Plugin

This plugin bundles JAXB libraries, and is a so-called _library plugin_.

It is currently not recommended to depend on it from your plugin.
It is designed to be automatically added as a dependency when running Jenkins on a Java 11 runtime, so that plugins using JAXB API do not fail on Java 11 (given JAXB libraries were removed from the JDK in Java 9).

See the link:CHANGELOG.adoc[CHANGELOG].
